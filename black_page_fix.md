# Black Page Issue - Diagnosis and Solution

## Problem
The webpage was displaying a completely black page instead of the intended game content.

## Root Cause
This is a Phaser.js game project where the three essential scene functions were empty:
- `preload()` - responsible for loading game assets
- `create()` - responsible for creating game objects and scenes
- `update()` - responsible for game loop updates

Without any content in these functions, Phaser.js would load but display nothing, resulting in a black canvas.

## Available Assets
The project has game assets ready to use:
- `sky.png` - background image
- `platform.png` - ground/platform sprites
- `dude.png` - player character spritesheet
- `star.png` - collectible item
- `bomb.png` - obstacle/enemy

## Solution Applied
Added basic game functionality to `main.js`:

1. **Asset Loading**: Added code to load all available assets in `preload()`
2. **Scene Creation**: Added background and platform creation in `create()`
3. **Visual Elements**: Added sky background, ground platform, floating platforms, and a star

## Result
The black page issue is now resolved. The game displays a proper scene with:
- Sky background
- Ground platform
- Multiple floating platforms
- A star for visual interest

The foundation is now in place for further game development (player character, physics, interactions, etc.).
